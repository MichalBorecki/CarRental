# CarRental

**CarRental** is a Java Web Application created as a <b>final project</b> of CodersLab Bootcamp: 'Java developer Web' which I attended: 09/04-08/06 2018.

CarRental is my idea for an application to manage a car rental company, however, some of the implemented functionalities have been used for learning and assimilate the knowledge gained during bootcamp course.


Application features for users:
- user can use the application on his smartphone - websites are responsive;
- marks the user's position on the map;
- marks the cars for rental on the map;
- indicates the shortest route to the nearest car;
- allows to send a message to the business owner;
- displaying the currently rented car data;
- displaying the history of rentals, charts, rental fees;
- display the list of messages sent and received.


Application features for the business owner:
- marks not rented cars on the map;
- sending a message to the car service with a link to the map with the location of car;
- displaying a list of all cars with additional informations;
- user search (by surname, first name, username);
- activating / deactivating the user account;
- displaying a list of messages for a given user (sent and received);
- displaying the history of rentals;
- adding a new car, editing and deleting;
